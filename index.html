			<h1>Eberron: Ashes of the Last War</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the fourth instance of this website. I've removed the whole Daanvi theme thing I was going for before&#8212;it kinda wasn't working out. I've also retired the splash page. Anyway, there are talky boat rides and exciting explosive fights and sad backstories. I guess we're dealing with plane-wide stakes now, since we have to stop this demon of war, who is also responsible for the Dragonmarks.</p>

		<summary><h2>Timeline So Far</h2></summary>
			
			<p>Eberron is a perfectly cyclical universe that follows a perfect cyclical calendar. <a href="https://sagas-of-eberron.obsidianportal.com/wikis/eberron-calendar">Here's how Earth and Eberron's calendar correspond with each other</a>.</p>
			
			<p>All notes from before Lharvion 997 YK are from Anemone. Notes during and after are from no one's perspective.</p>
			
		<h3>994 YK</h3>
		
			<ul>
				<li><b>20 Olarune.</b> Cyre is destroyed, down to its exact borders. Was it an epic spell? A weapon of true mass destruction? Did another nation or university beat us to <i>it?</i></li>
			</ul>
			
		<h3>996 YK</h3>
		
			<ul>
				<li><b>11 Aryth.</b> Treaty of Thronehold is signed. The nations are recognized, House Cannith is ordered to destroy all creation forges, and the Warforged are finally recognized as sentient beings. Rightfully so! They are fellow children of Khorvaire.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>Mid Vult.</b> Hired as a research assistant with some other strangers. They are a strange bunch. I doubt they know their arcane law.</li>
				<li><b>Late Vult.</b> The boat is awfully small, as are my accomodations. I agreed to work, but there hasn&#8217;t been much for me to do. Perhaps things will stay uneventful till we reach the Lantern Tower.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<h3>997 YK</h3>
		
			<ul>
				<li><b>1 Zarantyr.</b> New year&#8217;s and I&#8217;m stuck on a cramped boat. This is a time for feasts and parties, and here I am, stuck in my room reading.</li>
				<li><b>Mid Zarantyr.</b> Arrival in Vralkak. Monster nation. I sure hope none of us will meet with a trio of hags that will trick us into doing their bidding.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>Early Olarune.</b> We draw close to Zarash’ak. Our five week journey ends at last. Soon we will reach the Lantern Tower and divine its secrets.</li>
				<li><b>Mid Olarune.</b> A week in this dreadful place! Glumtown is almost a fitting name. It is Glum. But it is barely a village.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>Early Therendor.</b> Back to Zarash&#8217;ak and then back to Vralkak. We&#8217;ve just made port. Almost two weeks, and still I think of those bodies. They were all like Saron. Bloodless, markless. What can this monster <i>do?</i></li>
				<li><b>Mid Therendor.</b> After a week of ship travel and a day of foot travel, I sleep tonight not under the stars, but under Valon’s rear end. That man needs to learn what a shower is.</li>
				<li><b>Late Therendor.</b> Strange red lightning and grey stone... And now, the gnollish village of Znir. Strange visions.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>Early Eyre.</b> Arrival at the Great Crag. By means we did not chose.</li>
				<li><b>Middle Eyre.</b> Tomorrow, Sora Katra and Leonus will speak. What she will ask, we know not.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>Early Dravago.</b> We arrive again to Vralkak. But there's no time to waste. We must get back to Sharn, fast.</li>
				<li><b>Late Dravago.</b> The towers of Sharn greet us once more. But I dread our arrival. There is so much to do, and I fear we might not be able to do it all in time.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>Early Lharvion.</b> Arrival in New Cyre on the party's stolen airship.</li>
				<li><b>Late Lharvion.</b> Arrival to Arythawn Keep.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Early Barrakas.</b> Arrival to Kalazart.</li>

		<summary><h2>The Towers</h2></summary>
			
			<p>We have quested and discovered the locations of five ancient goblinoid towers, all of which likely contain artificial black dragonshards. Also stone machines that are aspects of the Fury of War. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yc3xsxv2">The map of towers is here</a> and the key is below.</p>

			<p>Elar told Leonus about the four kinds of black dragonshards:</p>
				<ul>
    				  <li>All dragonshards create dragonmarks.</li>
    				  <li>Breland and Zilargo dragonshards absorb magic and cause magic poisoning.</li>
   				  <li>Shadow Marches, Droaam, and Demon Wastes dragonshards explode.</li>
    				  <li>Mournland, Darguun, and Valenar dragonshards randomly change the properties of spells cast through them.</li>

You can do this with the Use an Item action, provided you have the requisite amount of Eberron/Red Dragonshards. If you &#8220;consume&#8221; more pounds of these dragonshards per day than your proficiency bonus, you'll suffer magic poisoning, which has varying effects that grow more severe the further past your limit that you push. &#40;Ross, d. 2020-02-12.&#41;</td>

This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use Eberron dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise &#40;the dust’s market value is the same as the replaced component&#41;. &#40;ERLW 275; Ross d. 2021-01-05.&#41;</td>
